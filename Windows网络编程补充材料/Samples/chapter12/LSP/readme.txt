This code sample illustrates a Winsock 2 layered service provider (LSP).
An LSP is a method of inserting a layer between the Winsock 2 API and
applications. This is achieved by creating a DLL which implements the 
entire set of Winsock provider functions. These functions begin with
the three letters WSP. You can consult the Platform SDK documentation
for the specifics on these functions.


LAYERED SERVICE PROVIDERS

There are two types of LSPs. The first type is known as a base provider.
A base provider exposes access to a protocol (such as TCP/IP). Not only
does it require a user mode DLL which implements the WSP functions but
it also requires a kernel mode component which communicates with the
underlying protocol driver (usually via the TDI interface - consult
the DDK for TDI information).

The other type of LSP is the type we mentioned in the first paragraph.
It is a layer that lies above a base provider which is what this sample
is. You can install this LSP above any installed base provider. Microsoft
operating systems ship with a variety of base providers such as 
'MSAFD Tcpip [TCP/IP]' (the TCP/IP provider). You can even install this
LSP over other installed LSPs.


INSTALLING THE LSP

When you build the sample, two files are generated: instlsp.exe and
lsp.dll. The first file is the installation program for installing
the LSP into the Winsock catalog while the second file is the DLL
which implements our LSP. The DLL should be copied to %SYSTEMROOT%\System32
before installation.

You need to determine which providers you want to install the LSP over
before beginning. To get a list of the installed providers, execute
the following command:

    C:\>instlsp.exe -p
    1001 - MSAFD ATM AAL5
    1002 - MSAFD Tcpip [TCP/IP]
    1003 - MSAFD Tcpip [UDP/IP]
    1004 - MSAFD Tcpip [RAW/IP]
    1005 - RSVP UDP Service Provider
    1006 - RSVP TCP Service Provider
    1007 - MSAFD NetBIOS [\Device\NetBT_Tcpip_{74427F6E-EAED-4823-A03A-3759EBBB760B}] SEQPACKET 0
    1008 - MSAFD NetBIOS [\Device\NetBT_Tcpip_{74427F6E-EAED-4823-A03A-3759EBBB760B}] DATAGRAM 0
    1009 - MSAFD NetBIOS [\Device\NetBT_Tcpip_{E62BE309-3888-44C2-9A27-D981A3EB7EF5}] SEQPACKET 1
    1010 - MSAFD NetBIOS [\Device\NetBT_Tcpip_{E62BE309-3888-44C2-9A27-D981A3EB7EF5}] DATAGRAM 1
    1011 - MSAFD NetBIOS [\Device\NetBT_Tcpip_{A4BCF3EF-6D3E-46D0-93EF-6EBAF4E7F4FD}] SEQPACKET 2
    1012 - MSAFD NetBIOS [\Device\NetBT_Tcpip_{A4BCF3EF-6D3E-46D0-93EF-6EBAF4E7F4FD}] DATAGRAM 2
    1013 - MSAFD NetBIOS [\Device\NetBT_Tcpip_{4B4CCD46-9338-45DE-954C-3A379C17574A}] SEQPACKET 3
    1014 - MSAFD NetBIOS [\Device\NetBT_Tcpip_{4B4CCD46-9338-45DE-954C-3A379C17574A}] DATAGRAM 3
    1015 - MSAFD NetBIOS [\Device\NetBT_Tcpip_{F16E07AD-74F0-44E9-9731-DB72B9C4DD25}] SEQPACKET 4
    1016 - MSAFD NetBIOS [\Device\NetBT_Tcpip_{F16E07AD-74F0-44E9-9731-DB72B9C4DD25}] DATAGRAM 4
    1017 - MSAFD NetBIOS [\Device\NetBT_Tcpip_{14A9C4D0-76AC-4E14-BC60-C8DE25746F94}] SEQPACKET 5
    1018 - MSAFD NetBIOS [\Device\NetBT_Tcpip_{14A9C4D0-76AC-4E14-BC60-C8DE25746F94}] DATAGRAM 5

This prints the current Winsock catalog. The first number is the catalog
ID followed by the string name of the corresponding Winsock provider.
This particular machine is Windows 2000 with TCP/IP, TCP/IP QOS, NetBIOS, 
and ATM providers. You will need the catalog IDs of the layers you wish
to install the LSP over. Note that if you should install the LSP over
all the providers for a given protocol family. That is if you want to 
install over the TCP provider you should also install over the UDP
and RAW providers (and probably the QOS providers as well). This is 
because there are certain applications (like Internet Explorer) which
call the function select with SOCKET handles from different providers
(UDP and TCP) which will fail if you're layered over only one of the
these two providers.

Once you've determined which providers you want to intall over, you need
to perform the installation of the LSP into the Winsock catalog with the
-i option. You'll also need to specify a '-o ID' for each catalog entry
you want to layer over. For example, to layer over all the TCP/IP providers
(except QOS) you would execute the following command:

    C:\>instlsp.exe -i -o 1002 -o 1003 -o 1004 -n "Foobar"
    LSP name is 'Foobar'
    Installing layer: Foobar over [MSAFD Tcpip [TCP/IP]]
    Installing layer: Foobar over [MSAFD Tcpip [UDP/IP]]
    Installing layer: Foobar over [MSAFD Tcpip [RAW/IP]]

The '-n Name' option specifies the name of our LSP. You can verify the LSP
installation by calling 'instlsp.exe -p'.

    C:\>instlsp -p
    1042 - Foobar over [MSAFD Tcpip [TCP/IP]]
    1043 - Foobar over [MSAFD Tcpip [UDP/IP]]
    1044 - Foobar over [MSAFD Tcpip [RAW/IP]]
    1001 - MSAFD ATM AAL5
    1002 - MSAFD Tcpip [TCP/IP]
    1003 - MSAFD Tcpip [UDP/IP]
    1004 - MSAFD Tcpip [RAW/IP]
    1005 - RSVP UDP Service Provider
    1006 - RSVP TCP Service Provider

    1041 - Foobar

You'll notice that for each provider that we're layering over there is a
new provider for our LSP (in this example, those entries with IDs 1042, 
1042, and 1042). Additionally there is an extra entry entitled just "Foobar".
This is the hidden (or dummy) entry for our LSP. It is required because
before we can insert our LSP into another protocol's chain we must have
a catalog ID and you don't get a catalog ID until you install a provider.
So you install a dummy provider first to obtain a valid catalog ID which you
then use in the protocol chains for the actual layered providers you install.

As a shortcut, if you wish to install the LSP over every currently installed
provider, specify -a instead of the individual '-o ID' flag, as in:

    C:\>instlsp -i -a -n "Foobar"


REMOVING THE LSP

Removing the sample LSP is the simplest step. Just make the following call:

    C:\>instlsp.exe -r

This will remove the dummy entry as well as each layered entry. Note that 
with this sample, you cannot install the LSP more than once (that is you 
can't install the LSP over the IP providers and then try to install it
over the newly created LSP entries). This is because the LSP sample uses
a GUID to uniquely identify itself. If you attempt to install it twice, 
Winsock 2 catches the fact that a provider already exists with the given
GUID and the installation will fail.

In the event that the Winsock catalog becomes so screwed up, you can
remove all layered entries with the following call:

    C:\>instlsp.exe -f
