    This sample illustrates how to programmatically retrieve IP configuration
    information similar to the IPCONFIG.EXE utility.  It demonstrates how to use
    the IP Helper APIs GetNetworkParams() and GetAdaptersInfo().

    To execute this application, simply build the application using the Microsoft Visual C++
    (Version 5 SP 3 or newer) nmake.exe program generation utility to make an executable
    ipconfig.exe.  After the build is complete, simply execute the resulting ipconfig.exe
    program.
