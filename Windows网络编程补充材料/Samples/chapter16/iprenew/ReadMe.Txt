    This sample illustrates how to programmatically release and renew IP addresses
    obtained through DHCP.  This program also demonstrates how to retrieve existing
    network adapter configuration information.

    IP address assignment from DHCP can be updated using the IpRenewAddress() and
    IpReleaseAddress() IP Helper APIs.  These APIs require you to understand adapter
    index numbers.  In Windows, every network adapter has a unique index ID.  Adapter
    index IDs can be retrieved using the GetAdaptersInfo() IP Helper API.  This program
    features a list option that displays current network adapter configuration
    information showing all adapters index numbers associated with their corresponding
    network adaptors.

    To execute this application, simply build the application using the Visual C++
    (Version 5 SP 3 or newer) Nmake.exe program generation facility.  An iprenew.exe
    program should result.  Execute the iprenew.exe with the following parameters:

    Iprenew.exe [ -l ] [ -r<index id> ] [ -n<index id> ]

        -l List adapters with corresponding index ID information
        -r Release IP address for adapter index ID
        -n Renew IP address for adapter index ID
