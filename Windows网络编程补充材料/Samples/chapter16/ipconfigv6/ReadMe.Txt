information.  It demonstrates how to use the IP Helper APIs GetAdaptersAddresses().

To execute this application, simply build the application using the Microsoft Visual C++
(Version 5 SP 3 or newer) nmake.exe program generation utility to make an executable
ipconfigv6.exe.  After the build is complete, simply execute the resulting ipconfigv6.exe
program on a Windows XP machine with the IPv6 stack installed.
