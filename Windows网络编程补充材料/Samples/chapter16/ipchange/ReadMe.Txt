    This sample illustrates how to programmatically change an IP address for 
    a specific network adapter on your machine.  This program also demonstrates how
    to retrieve existing network adapter IP configuration information.

    IP configurations can be changed for a specific network adapter by using the
    AddIpAddress() and DeleteIpAddress() Ip Helper APIs.  These APIs require you to
    understand adapter index numbers and IP context numbers.  In Windows, every network
    adapter has a unique index ID and every IP address has a unique context ID.
    Adapter index IDs and IP context numbers can be retrieved using the GetAdaptersInfo()
    IP Helper API.  This program features a list option that displays current network
    adapter configuration information by showing all adapters index numbers and IP
    address context numbers associated with their corresponding network adaptors.

    To execute this application, simply build the application using the Visual C++
    (Version 5 SP 3 or better) Nmake.exe program generation facility.  An ipchange.exe
    program should result.  Execute the ipchange.exe with the following parameters:

    Ipchange.exe [ -l ] [ -a -n<index id> -i<ip address> -m<subnet mask> ]
                 [ -d -c<context id>]

        -l List adapter index IDs and IP Address context ID information
        -a Add IP Address option
        -d Delete IP Address option
        -i IP Address to specify with -a option
        -m Subnet Mask to specify with -a option
        -c IP context ID for an existing IP address
        -n Index ID of an existing network adapter
