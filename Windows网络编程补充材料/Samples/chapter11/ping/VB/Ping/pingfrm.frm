' Project: vbping
'
' Description:
'    This app implments ICMP echo requests (otherwise known as ping). It creates
'    a raw socket of the ICMP protocol and sends echo requests to the specified
'    remote host. Once the remote host receives these, it will respond with an
'    ICMP echo reply message. This tells you that the remote host is running and
'    accessible from the network. The user may specify the data size to send with
'    the echo request as well as request that the record route IP option should
'    be turned on as well. Note that when the record route option is specified,
'    some routers will discard these packets which will generate a time out
'    error. If this occurs turn off the record route option to see if the ICMP
'    requests then succeed.
